# Problem:
Our new company, called "srcatchbling" (SB) was formed to sell the world’s fanciest back scratchers. SB would like to have customers and other clients access an API to list all of the back scratchers that they are selling on the market. In order to complete this, you, the developer, must create a simple RESTful interface that will provide access to the company’s
database.

A simple example of a back scratcher for sale is:
```
Name              Description                       Size                Price
"The Itcher"      "Scratch any itch"                ["XL"]              "$27.00"
"The Blinger"     "Diamonds"                        ["L"]               "$343.00"
"Glitz and Gold"  "Gold handle and fancy emeralds"  ["XL","L","M","S"]  "$4,343.00"
```
